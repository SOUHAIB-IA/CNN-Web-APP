## Introduction  
This project is a web application developed with **Flask** for the frontend and **TensorFlow** as the backend to train neural networks interactively. Users can upload datasets, configure model parameters, launch training, and visualize results with real-time graphs. The application offers flexibility for users to experiment with various architectures and hyperparameters.  

---

## Features  
- **Data Upload:** Supports CSV files and image datasets.  
- **Model Configuration:**  
  - Set the number and type of layers (Dense, Convolutional, etc.).  
  - Choose activation functions, learning rate, and other hyperparameters.  
- **Training Visualization:** Real-time display of loss and accuracy curves using dynamic plots.  
- **Model Download:** Download trained models for future use.  
- **Simple and Intuitive UI:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend:** Flask, TensorFlow  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (optional for styling)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas
